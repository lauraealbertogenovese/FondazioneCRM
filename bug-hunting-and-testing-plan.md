curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/patients → Patient Service (3002)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/clinical → Clinical Service (3003)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/groups → Group Service (3004)

# Authentication Header Forwarding
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token> → Passed to all services

# Error Handling
Service Down → 503 Service Unavailable
Invalid Route → 404 Not Found
Timeout → 408 Request Timeout
```

#### **📊 Real Data Integration Testing**
```javascript
// Verify No Mock Data Remains
const dataSourceTests = {
  dashboard: "All statistics from real API calls",
  patientStats: "Live count from database",
  clinicalRecords: "Dynamic from clinical service", 
  groupMetrics: "Real-time group statistics",
  systemMonitoring: "Actual service health checks"
};

// Test Data Flow: Database → Service → API → Frontend
```

### **2.2 Database Integrity Testing**

#### **🗄️ PostgreSQL Schema Validation**
```sql
-- Schema Separation Test
SELECT schemaname FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname IN ('auth', 'patient', 'clinical', 'group');

-- Foreign Key Constraints
SELECT * FROM information_schema.table_constraints WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';

-- Index Performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM patient.patients WHERE codice_fiscale = 'RSSMRA80A01H501Z';

-- Data Consistency
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM patient.patients p
LEFT JOIN clinical.clinical_records cr ON p.id = cr.patient_id;
```

#### **🔒 GDPR Compliance Validation**
```bash
# Privacy Controls Testing
✓ Consent tracking → consenso_trattamento_dati field
✓ Data separation → Clinical vs administrative access
✓ Audit logs → who accessed what when
✓ Data retention → automatic cleanup policies
✓ Patient rights → data export/deletion capability
```

✓ Strong password policy → Complexity requirements
✓ Brute force protection → Rate limiting on login attempts
```

#### **🛡️ Input Sanitization Testing**
```javascript
const securityTests = {
  sqlInjection: {
    payloads: ["'; DROP TABLE patients; --", "1' OR '1'='1"],
    expectedResult: "Sanitized/rejected, no database impact"
  },
  xssAttempts: {
    payloads: ["<script>alert('xss')</script>", "javascript:alert(1)"],
    expectedResult: "HTML encoded, script not executed"
  },
  fileUpload: {
    maliciousFiles: ["virus.exe", "script.bat", "malware.php"],
    expectedResult: "File type validation rejects dangerous files"
  }
};
```
